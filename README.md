# VectorOperation-c-
# Vector Operations Demo

This repository contains a C++ program demonstrating various operations on vectors, such as sorting, searching, and removing duplicates. The program is designed to provide a hands-on experience with fundamental vector operations and algorithms in C++.

## Features

- **Random Number Generation:** Populates a vector with randomly generated integers within a specified range.
- **Sorting Algorithms:** Includes bubble sort to organize vector elements in ascending order.
- **Binary Search:** Finds a specific element in the vector and counts its occurrences.
- **Duplicate Removal:** Eliminates duplicate elements from the vector to retain unique values.
- **Vector Display:** Outputs the contents, size, and capacity of the vector at different stages.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system (e.g., g++, clang++).
